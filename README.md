 Linear search, also called as orderly search or sequential search, because each crucial element that is considered the search key is searched from the first element in an array, to final element in an array.
 *Linear search is used in the book library in:*
*  checking if the ISBN entered is a duplicate of another Book‚Äôs ISBN. ( Add and Modify)
*  the Delete function as the program searches for the ISBN index of book entered in order to delete its data.
*  Advanced search when looking for the keyword entered in all the books in the library.
*  Query search as the program searches for the index of the searched ISBN in order to print all the book‚Äôs data.
